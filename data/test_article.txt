Waymo’s driverless robotaxis will soon be driving outside San Francisco’s borders to cities north of San Mateo, as the company begins its expansion to the Peninsula.

The autonomous vehicle company announced Friday that it will test fully driverless rides in Daly City, Brisbane, South San Francisco, Colma, San Bruno, Millbrae and Burlingame “in the coming weeks.” The driverless ride-hailing in this area of the Peninsula will be available only to Waymo employees, though it is a precursor to the company’s eventual commercial expansion in the Bay Area.

The California Public Utilities Commission granted Waymo permission in March to expand its paid driverless ride-hailing service to 22 Peninsula cities without restrictions. The company says it will test its vehicles in its approved service area — which spans to Sunnyvale in Santa Clara County — south of Burlingame with a human backup driver behind the wheel.

Waymo won’t be testing its autonomous vehicles at San Francisco International Airport, as the company requires separate permission from the city of San Francisco to operate there.

It’s unclear when the company plans to expand its commercial ride-hailing beyond the borders of San Francisco, where people who’ve been approved off a waitlist can hail a driverless Waymo at all hours.

The company’s gradual expansion to the Peninsula is similar to how it expanded in San Francisco — limiting service, at first, to employees and utilizing backup drivers.

“Expanding our service across the Peninsula will take time,” Waymo said in its announcement. “We’ll continue taking a careful and incremental approach, following our safety framework and working closely with city officials, local communities, and first responders.”
